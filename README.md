## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.

- It was a lot of work designing everything but I learned a lot.
- I had some trouble with NextJS and Supabase but I worked through it

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
